I was looking into the explore section of github and stumbled upon this [[Praject Based Learning Repository]] read this blog post where a guy tries a BIG project to remind himself of important enginering concepts like:

- C++ PROGRAMMING
- OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
- DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
- NETWORKING WITH SERVER/CLIENT MODEL
- CONCURRENCY CONTROL WITH MULTI-PROCESSORS OR MULTI-THREADING
- IO PROBLEM WITH DISK ACCESS AND USE OF FILE SYSTEM



Since I want to build a real project with C++ and improve my skills in this programming language I think this might be worth following up to replicate his steps. 

For some reason that I think I KNOW I want to be good at C++. Reasons that come to my mind:

- NodeJS is written in C++ and If I want to contribute I'll have to be good at it
- Never built a real production ready project in C++ SINCE I graduated and wanna Know If I can do it
- Javascript feels like is too easy
- C++ is used in embbedded systems and by learning it I might be able to work on those projects in the future. I'm getting bored of working on web development


This project is made of the following parts:

1. [[What and Why Key-Value Stores]]
2. [[Using Existing key-value Stores]]
3. [[Comparative Analysis of Arquitectures of Kyoto Cabinet and LevelDB]]
4. [[Api Design - Key-Value-Store]]
5. [[Hash Table Implementations]]
6. [[Open-Addressing Hash Tables]]
