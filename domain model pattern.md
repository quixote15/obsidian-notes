Motivation: In contrary to the [[Transaction Script Pattern]] the domain model pattern is meant to be used when "you have complex business logic"

Disclaimer 1: Domain model should be used when you have "COMPLEX BUSINESS LOGIC". What exactly is the complexity here? 



What is this pattern?

Consists of organizing the business logic as an object model consisting of classes with state and behavior.

The DDD has some tactical patterns which serves as building blocks for domain models:

- [[Entity]]
- [[Value Object]]
- [[Factory]]
- [[Repository]]
- [[Service]]
- [[Aggregates]]
