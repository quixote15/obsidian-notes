Google had limitation with its previous languages (c/c++, python, java)

C/C++ Takes a long time to compile
Java Verbosity and complexity
Python not so performant

go aims to solve all those probles. To be simple, concise, performant and fast to compile. Also, to tackle multi-threading & concurrency, race condition detection.


What else? built-in tests and low learning curve.
