Is usually reffered to a virtual machine that runs javascript code. NodeJS is an example of a javascript runtime!

Those runtimes today are built with Chrome V8 or javascriptCore which are libraries that reads javascript code and executes them in multiple machines and/or enviroments.

I've encounted the [[Lemon]] framework which is a good starting point for creating your own JS runtime.
